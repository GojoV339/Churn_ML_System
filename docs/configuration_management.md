# Configuration Management

Hardcoded paths and thresholds create fragile systems.

All runtime behavior is controlled through:

config/settings.yaml

## Configurable Elements

- Production model path
- Prediction threshold
- Data locations

Benefits:
- behavior changes without code edits
- safer deployments
- environment flexibility

Configuration separates system behavior from implementation logic.
