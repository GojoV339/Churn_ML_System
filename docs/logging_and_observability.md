# Logging and Observability

Production systems require visibility into model behavior.

A centralized logging module records:

- prediction requests
- validation failures
- prediction outputs
- latency measurements

Logs are written to:

logs/system.log

## Purpose

Logging enables:
- debugging failures
- monitoring performance
- understanding real-world usage patterns

Observability ensures the system can be operated and trusted after deployment.
